      <description>tl;dr: customize your command prompt in a modular manner
Available on GitHub.
Prompt Framework is a small framework that modularizes your command prompt, and allows you to customize it by arranging different modules together.
One use case is to allow simple reuse of different components in different environments. For example, there might be some items you wish to display on your prompt at work. However, these items may be proprietary and not available publicly.</description>

      <description>tl;dr: service to continuously change port sequence for knockd.

The way the knock sequence is generated will depend on which script is used for generating them. The basic layout of this repository is as follows:
 generators/: stores different scripts that generate knock sequences update.</description>

      <description>tl;dr: generate password based on a collection of text files.
Available on GitHub.
There are many ways to generate a password. If we use a password manager, we can usually generate a random string with different characters, numbers, and symbols. Then, we simply copy and paste those passwords to login.
However, sometimes, we may wish to manually type out the password. For example, we may want to login on a machine that is not ours (and so we do not wish to set up our password manager on that machine).</description>
